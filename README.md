# RepoDb – A Hybrid ORM for .NET

RepoDb is an open-source .NET ORM library that bridges micro-ORMs and full-featured ORMs. It provides a simple, high-performance data access layer with support for basic CRUD operations, advanced queries, caching, batch/bulk operations, and more.

**Active Fork** – This is an actively maintained fork of the original RepoDb repository, with improvements including multi-column primary key support, JSON columns, Vector columns, type coercion, and Oracle database support.

## Key Features

- **Easy to Use** – All operations are extension methods on `IDbConnection`. Simple, intuitive API.
- **High Performance** – Caches compiled expressions and generates optimal SQL based on your schema.
- **Memory Efficient** – Extracts and reuses object properties, mappings, and SQL statements throughout execution.
- **Flexible** – Supports atomic, batch, and bulk operations for datasets of any size. Both synchronous and asynchronous methods available.
- **Type Coercion** – Advanced type conversion between databases with AOT-compiled expressions and custom conversion support.
- **JSON Support** – Full support for JSON columns and JSON-backed serialized columns.
- **Vector Support** – Seamless handling of Vector columns via `ReadOnlyMemory<float>`.
- **Comprehensive Testing** – 10,000+ unit and integration tests for production reliability.
- **Open Source** – Free and community-driven with an active development roadmap.

## Fork Improvements

This fork enhances the original RepoDb with:

- **Multi-Column Primary Keys** – Proper detection and handling across all operations
- **Advanced Type Coercion** – JIT-time conversion makes SQLite work as a drop-in replacement for testing
- **JSON Columns** – Native support for JSON and serialized column types
- **Vector Columns** – Support for vector types in databases that provide this feature
- **Oracle Support** – New Oracle provider package ensuring standards compliance
- **Better NULL Handling** – Improved conversions for enums and modern .NET types (DateOnly, TimeOnly)
- **IParsable/IFormattable Support** – Automatic handling of types implementing these interfaces

## Quick Start

Choose your database platform:

- **[SQL Server](docs/getstarted/sqlserver.md)** – Full-featured support with Microsoft.Data.SqlClient
- **[SQLite](docs/getstarted/sqlite.md)** – Perfect for testing and embedded scenarios
- **[MySQL](docs/getstarted/mysql.md)** – Popular relational database support
- **[Oracle](docs/getstarted/oracle.md)** – Enterprise database support
- **[PostgreSQL](docs/getstarted/postgresql.md)** – Advanced open-source database

### Example Usage

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
	connection.Open();

	// Query
	var customers = connection.QueryAll<Customer>();
	var active = connection.Query<Customer>(c => c.IsActive == true);

	// Insert
	var customer = new Customer { Name = "John", Email = "john@example.com" };
	connection.Insert(customer);

	// Update
	customer.Name = "Jane";
	connection.Update(customer);

	// Delete
	connection.Delete(customer);

	// Bulk Operations
	var customers = GetLargeDataset();
	connection.BulkInsert(customers); // Sets identity values automatically
}
```

## Supported Databases

### Core Execute Methods (All Databases)

- `ExecuteQuery` – Execute queries and materialize results
- `ExecuteNonQuery` – Execute commands without returning data
- `ExecuteScalar` – Execute queries returning a single value
- `ExecuteReader` – Execute and get a DataReader
- `ExecuteQueryMultiple` – Execute multiple queries in one call

### Fluent API (Specific Providers)

The fluent LINQ-style API is available for:

- [SQL Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AmpScm.RepoDb.SqlServer)
- [SQLite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AmpScm.RepoDb.SqLite.Microsoft)
- [MySQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AmpScm.RepoDb.MySql)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AmpScm.RepoDb.PostgreSql)
- [Oracle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AmpScm.RepoDb.Oracle)

Operations: `Query`, `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Merge`, `BulkInsert`, `BulkUpdate`, `BulkDelete`, `BulkMerge`

## Advanced Features

### Type Coercion & Conversion

RepoDb provides advanced type conversion between databases:

- **Automatic Conversion** – Smart type mapping with AOT-compiled expressions
- **Property Handlers** – Custom Get/Set transformation logic for specialized types
- **Modern .NET Support** – Built-in support for `DateOnly`, `TimeOnly`, enums with NULL handling
- **IParsable/IFormattable** – Automatic handling of types implementing these interfaces
- **Cross-Database Testing** – SQLite works as a drop-in replacement for other databases during testing

**Property Handlers Example:**

```csharp
// Define a custom handler
public class EncryptedStringHandler : IPropertyHandler<string, string>
{
	public string Get(string input, PropertyHandlerGetOptions options)
		=> Decrypt(input);

	public string Set(string input, PropertyHandlerSetOptions options)
		=> Encrypt(input);
}

// Option 1: Via attribute
public class Customer
{
	public int Id { get; set; }

	[PropertyHandler(typeof(EncryptedStringHandler))]
	public string SensitiveData { get; set; }
}

// Option 2: Via fluent mapper (global)
FluentMapper
	.Entity<Customer>()
	.PropertyHandler(c => c.SensitiveData, new EncryptedStringHandler());

// Option 3: Via static mapper
PropertyHandlerMapper.Add<Customer, EncryptedStringHandler>(
	c => c.SensitiveData,
	new EncryptedStringHandler());
```

### Exception Handling

RepoDb provides clear, descriptive exception messages:

- Custom exceptions with detailed context during hydration
- Native exception bubbling from ADO.NET
- No exception swallowing – errors reach you immediately

### Setup, Connection Management

For SQL Server and other providers, initialization is typically done with a single call at startup. However, you can explicitly configure providers:

```csharp
// Initialize RepoDB and register a specific implementation
GlobalConfiguration.Setup().UseSqlServer();

// Or with custom options
GlobalConfiguration.Setup(new()
{
    DateOnlyAndTimeOnly = true,
});
```

If you want to register your own implementations instead of using the standard mappings you could use something like this:

```csharp
// Setup RepoDB
GlobalConfiguration.Setup(new()
{
    DateOnlyAndTimeOnly = true,
});

// Manual provider registration, like for the legacy System.Data.SqlClient
DbSettingMapper.Add<SqlConnection>(new SqlServerDbSetting(), true);
DbHelperMapper.Add<SqlConnection>(new SqlServerDbHelper(), true);
StatementBuilderMapper.Add<SqlConnection>(new SqlServerStatementBuilder(), true);
```

### SSL/Certificate Issues

If using `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`, you may encounter certificate validation issues:

```csharp
// Add to connection string:
"TrustServerCertificate=true;"
```

**Warning:** Only enable `TrustServerCertificate` when necessary, as it bypasses security validation.

## Performance

RepoDb is highly optimized for data access operations:

- **Expression Caching** – Compiled expressions are cached and reused for maximum performance
- **Memory Efficiency** – Property extraction and mapping is cached throughout execution
- **Minimal Overhead** – Thin layer over ADO.NET with smart compilation strategies

**Performance Note:** The first execution includes AOT compilation overhead. For accurate benchmarking, exclude the first execution from measurements.
